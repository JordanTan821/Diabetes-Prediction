# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
Diabetes affects millions of people worldwide, placing significant pressure on healthcare systems and leading to substantial social and economic costs. One of the key challenges is the lack of early detection and effective management, which often results in severe complications and reduced quality of life for individuals.

This project aims to develop a robust classification predictive model to accurately identify individuals at a higher risk of developing diabetes at an early stage. By detecting high-risk individuals before symptoms appear, preventive measures can be implemented to slow the progression of the disease and minimize its impact.

The focus of this project is to build a model with high accuracy, precision, and recall scores to ensure that individuals with diabetes, or those at risk, are identified accurately and reliably. This approach not only enhances early intervention but also contributes to better healthcare outcomes and resource management.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Algorithms Used
• Support Vector Machine (SVM)
• Decision Tree 
• Naïve Bayes
• K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

## Result
The best-performing model was **Decision Tree**, achieving an accuracy of **97.66%**.
